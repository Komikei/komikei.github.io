        Valve was founded in 1996 by former longtime Microsoft employees 
        Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Wanting to move onto a
        new venture using their shared wealth, they founded Valve, L.L.C.
        in Kirkland, Washington on August 24, 1996. After the critical and
        commercial success of their debut product, the first-person shooter
        Half-Life, Valve launched Steam in 2003. Steam accounted for around
        half of digital PC game sales by 2011. By 2012, Valve employed 
        around 250 people and was reportedly worth over US$3 billion, making
        it the most profitable company per employee in the United States.
        In the 2010s, Valve began developing hardware, such as the Steam 
        Machine, a brand of gaming PCs, as well as the HTC Vive and Valve 
        Index virtual reality headsets.
