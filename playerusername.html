    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>When registering for an account, users are prompted to create a profile to help other users distinguish you from others. Customization features include profile backgrounds, avatars, profile description and the ability to feature a Steam Badge. Users may edit their profile at any time by clicking the Edit Profile button on the top right of their profile.</p>
    <h2>Profile Levels</h2>
    <p><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/steam/images/c/c3/Profilelevel.png/revision/latest?cb=20191020154913"></p>
    <p>Profile Levels are shown on the top-right hand of the user's profile, and provide benefits such as Showcasing unlocks, increasing the amount of friends a user can have at one time and increase the chance of a booster pack drop. Users may increase their level by crafting badges, collecting games, complete community tasks, obtaining event badges and automatically by owning a Steam account. Users that are Account Limited may not increase their level. When a user views another's profile, they see the user's inforomation from their profile page. They can see how much level the user is at and how many games or badges they own. Having a high level and many badges is tempting because one can show off to others.</p>
