    Steam is a video game digital distribution service by <a href=Valve>Valve</a>. It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for <a href=Valve>Valve</a> to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), matchmaking servers, video streaming, and social networking services. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality.
