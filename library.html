    <p>The steam library is mainly consisted of 2 sections: your downloaded content on the left side and the game storefront on the right, taking up a majoriy of the page.</p>
    <p>The downloaded content can include the games, software and other items of the kind. It is a list of everything you have in store and even if the useris on a different computer, his account still has his same library and he can download from it. You can also mark put some games as favorite. Once you mark something as a favorite, it sticks to the top of your list and it is easier to find your game.</p>
    <p>The game storefront includes the following components: last played, playtime, friends who play the game, news about the game, owned dlcs, achievements and screenshots. It also includes the download button from which you can download your game and after downloading, the button turns into the play button from which you can open the game or close it. It also has subcategories of the following: Store page, community hub, find groups, discussions, guides, workshops, support. These functions are really useful and convenient because it allows you to interact with these subjects in a faster way without having to manually find every one of them.</p>
