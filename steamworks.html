    <p>Steamworks is Valve's API that helps software developers integrate Steam functions such as achievements and online matchmaking into their software. It is free to all software developers that are actively creating and publishing software to the Steam storefront, and provides numerous benefits that can be integrated into software in tandem with Steam's own functionality.</p>
    <p>The API focuses mainly on integrating basic Steam functions into software, such as matchmaking services, anti-cheat software, achievement management, ability to access the Steam overlay, support for Steam friend and group integration and the ability to save software data into the Steam Cloud. Software developers are able to track sales in the Steam storefront.</p>
